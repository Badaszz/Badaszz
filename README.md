## 👨‍💻 About Me  
I am a Mechatronics Engineering graduate passionate about robotics, AI, and automation.
I am more interested in the software aspects of robotics but i also want to be well-rounded
My work spans embedded systems, computer vision, and intelligent control.  
I enjoy building systems that connect the physical and digital worlds — from drones to smart detection systems.
