## 👨‍💻 About Me  
I am a Mechatronics Engineering graduate passionate about robotics, AI, and automation.  
My primary focus is on the software aspects of robotics, though I aim to remain well-rounded with hardware experience.  
My work spans embedded systems, computer vision, and intelligent control.  
I enjoy building systems that connect the physical and digital worlds — from drones to smart detection systems.
